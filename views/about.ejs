        In the year 1996, a programmer from Japan who loved catching and studying bugs changed the world forever.
        Partnering with Nintendo, Satoshi Tajiri released a game called Pokémon and sent the entire world into a frenzy.
        Haters said that Pokémon was just a fad that would blow ever but fast forward to 28 years later and the Pokémon
        Company is bigger than ever. What started out as a pair of handheld games with a total memory of less than 8MB,
        is now a billion-dollar multinational company with their paws on every aspect of the pop culture.
        Video Games on modern consoles, TV shows, Movies, Collectible trading cards, and of course, their biggest moneymakers: Merchandise!

        <p>So, what is a Pokémon? Pocket Monsters, Pokémon, for short is a term coined by Satoshi Tajiri, are fantastical creatures of varying
        shapes and sizes that live in the Pokémon world. In 1996, there were only 151 Pokémon, but since then the Pokémon world has expanded and with each new instalment
        of the game comes a new batch of Pokémon. The current total is more than 1000 now. These creatures resemble everything from real world
        animals, to common household appliances. The limit is only the imagination of the artist.
        They can have elemental types like Fire, Water, Electric, Grass or just be plain Normal. There 18 different types and Pokémon can have between 1 and 2 of them.
        Pokémon roam freely in the wild but humans and Pokémon can also live in the Pokémon world together in harmony as some Pokémon can choose to be a companion to a human.
